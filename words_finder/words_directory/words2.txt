Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Sarah who lived in a small village in the countryside. She was an only child and her parents were very strict, so she had to follow all their rules.

One day, Sarah decided to explore the nearby forest. She had heard stories about a magical creature that lived there, and she wanted to find out if it was true. She ventured deep into the forest, and soon she came across a small cottage.

Curious, Sarah stepped inside and was amazed to find a beautiful fairy. The fairy explained that she was the guardian of the forest and that she had been watching Sarah for some time. She offered to grant Sarah three wishes, and Sarah eagerly accepted.

Sarah wished for a beautiful garden, a pet unicorn, and a castle of her own. The fairy granted her wishes and Sarah was overjoyed. She thanked the fairy and returned home, where she found that her wishes had come true.

Sarah was so happy with her new life that she never returned to the forest. She lived happily ever after in her castle with her pet unicorn and beautiful garden.
